# Quantitative Geopolitics Intelligence (QG Intel)
 
## Overview
Quantitative Geopolitics Intelligence (QG Intel) is an advanced analytical platform designed to unveil intricate patterns in geopolitical data. By harnessing a vast array of reputable data sources, including the World Bank, the Fund for Peace, Our World in Data, IMF, Freedom House, ACLED, SIPRI, and more, QG Intel synthesizes diverse datasets to reveal and interpret the subtle choreography of geopolitical trends.

## Features
- **Pattern Analysis**: Discerns correlating patterns between two nations across a variety of indices, offering insights that transcend the apparent, surface-level data.
- **Early Warning System**: Identifies historical precedents in geopolitical data to forecast potential future events, providing users with actionable foresight.
- **Comprehensive Indexing**: Engages with over 100 indices to provide a multi-faceted view of global dynamics, enabling a granular understanding of state behaviors.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Employs sophisticated plotting techniques to map the trajectories of geopolitical correlations, making complex data accessible and interpretable.
- **Flexible Querying**: Adapts to queries of varying specificity, from broad pattern searches to detailed analysis, accommodating an extensive range of user inquiries.
